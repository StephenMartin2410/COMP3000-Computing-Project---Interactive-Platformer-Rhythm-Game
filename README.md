# Original Project Vision - 
My vision for this project is to create a game that a user can interact with like a platformer and use the music being produced by the application as a means to traverse.

This means that a user will be able to listen to the music in the game and use the music to know when to move the player sprite or the music will be in time to a reappearing/moving platform. 

The user may be able to generate their own music or import their own music to use as an assistance in the games level creation.

The platformer will either by a vertical or side scroller style game.

This project is designed to be played by rhythm gamers or platform gamers who are looking for a game that uses music integration with platforming. The official name of the game is yet to be decided but the name of the project is Interactive Platformer Rhythm Game. This project will be used as a type of game to be enjoyed by any interested individuals as platformers and rhythm games are very simple concepts that can be enjoyed by a wide audience. The reason I will be creating this game is because many of my favourite games have outstanding music that links indirectly or somewhat directly to the game mechanics (such as the platformer Celeste) and I wanted to create a similar style of game in a simpler form that uses music as the full inspiration to the platforming design.

I hope to produce this game in C++ using OpenGL but this may change as the development continues.

# Changes In Project Vision
Due to a recalculation in the depth of my abilities, a significant unavoidable delay in workflow and the limitation of the original software, I have decided to change the project vision of this project, while keeping the original github repository so that it is still referencable. In my honest belief, the original project was too complicated and vague in design for me to percivably undergo its development, while outside personal matters were also a factor in the development of this project, I believe that this change in vision is vital and will help the development to continue and will be easier to expand on.

# Current Project Vision - 
My current vision for this project is to create a rhythm game similar to guitar hero or a mania style game with a more family-friendly, child-friendly theme to it. This game will be open-source and allow players to make their own maps for the songs in the game in the same application where they can play them. The user will be able to play and create these games by pressing four keys on their keyboard that correspond to notes that they will be able to hit and create in the game. The name of this game is Animal Frets, as it has a guitar based style and will eventually be animal themed and contain small animal sprites that will be animated to play the notes when the keys are pressed and will have a positive or negative animation to reflect a miss or hit. This application will be made using the unity 2d game engine and will be programmed using C#. Most of the assets of this game will be created using Microsoft Paint and will be simplistic and child-friendly. All the of the songs to be used in this game will be credited when used and will be within the creators copyright guidelines, the songs to be used so far in this application are by Kevin MacLeod. These songs are selected because this usecase is within the guidelines for copyright and are a fitting theme and style for the family-friendly aspects of the application. 

# How To Add Mp3
1. First launch the build exe of the application.
2. Then close the application by clicking the Quit button.
3. You can then navigate to the build folder's location and should be able to see the created folders MP3Folder and MapFolder. These are where the files of the program are stored.
4. To add a song to the game, just drag and drop a mp3 audio file into the MP3Folder.
5. Boot up the game again and you should see the newly added mp3 in the dropdown list next to the Create button.
6. Follow the steps below to learn how to use this file to make your own song map and play.

# How To Use 
Here is a comprehensive step-by-step guide on how to use this application.
1. First open the exe application file that is provided in a build version of the application. 
2. Press the Options button to be taken to the options menu.
3. From here you can modify the volume of all audio in the game or modify the movement speed of the notes to be higher or lower than default acorrding to your skill level.
4. Press the escape button on your keyboard to leave this menu.
5. Now browse the dropdown box selection next to the Create button and select the mp3 you would like to create a map for.
6. Then press the Create button.
7. Here you will be met with the basic create scene of the application, press the spacebar to start playing the mp3.
8. While the mp3 is playing, the keys M, N, B, V can be pressed to create notes that correspond to the notes being played from the audio.
9. Once you are satisfied with the creation of the map for the song, press the Create Map button.
10. Then press the escape key to return to the menu once again.
11. Now you can browse the dropdown box next to the Play button, which should contain your newly created song map file.
