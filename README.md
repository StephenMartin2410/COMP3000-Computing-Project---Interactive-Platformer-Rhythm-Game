My vision for this project is to create a game that a user can interact with like a platformer and use the music being produced by the application as a means to traverse.

This means that a user will be able to listen to the music in the game and use the music to know when to move the player sprite or the music will be in time to a reappearing/moving platform. 

The user may be able to generate their own music or import their own music to use as an assistance in the games level creation.

The platformer will either by a vertical or side scroller style game.

This project is designed to be played by rhythm gamers or platform gamers who are looking for a game that uses music integration with platforming. The official name of the game is yet to be decided but the name of the project is Interactive Platformer Rhythm Game. This project will be used as a type of game to be enjoyed by any interested individuals as platformers and rhythm games are very simple concepts that can be enjoyed by a wide audience. The reason I will be creating this game is because many of my favourite games have outstanding music that links indirectly or somewhat directly to the game mechanics (such as the platformer Celeste) and I wanted to create a similar style of game in a simpler form that uses music as the full inspiration to the platforming design.

I hope to produce this game in C++ using OpenGL but this may change as the development continues.
